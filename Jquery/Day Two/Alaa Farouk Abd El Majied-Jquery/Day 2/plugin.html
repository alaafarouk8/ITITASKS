        Fear arises with man since the beginning of his consciousness as a small child. It is one of the psychological
        cases that indicate the human awareness of the surrounding risks to avoid them.

        But there is a kind of fear that reaches the stage of mental illness, it is like obsessive-compulsive disorder,
        for example: Fear of illness, fear of death, and other examples that make negative thoughts dominate the
        thinking of their owner.

        Here the problem must be addressed before it gets worse and needs medical intervention and the patient is given
        certain types of medication.
